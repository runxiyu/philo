# Aristotle on love

## Dialogue between Socrates and Lysis on parental love

Conclusion: The one being loved requires knowledge

## Dialogue between Socrates and Menexenus on lover and beloved

* Either? A lover may be hated.
* Lover? A lover may be hated.
* Beloved? People are loved by enemy and hated by friends.
* Both? What about horse-lovers, dog-lovers, wine-lovers, wisdom-lovers, etc?
  (What about philosophers? Can knowledge love back?)

## Dialogue among Socrates, Lysis, and Menexenus on the like and the unlike

* Are the like and the unlike friends?
* Homer and some other natural philosophers support "the like to be friends to
  the like"
* Are the good or the bad friends?
  * Bad people harm each other
  * Good people cannot benefit each other as they do not desire anything
  * Therefore, neither the good or the bad may be friends among another, and
    thus the like cannot be friends.
* Hesiod, et al. supports the unlike to be friends
* But enemies cannot be friends; the unjust cannot be friends of the just; the
  bad cannot be friends of the good; thus the unlike cannot be friends, and only
  what is neither good nor bad can be friends.

## Importance of friendship

* Desire, due to deficiency, is the cause of loving.
* Deficiency is due to privation
* Privation presupposes something belonging to/proper to oneself

## Three-fold divisons of friendship

* Three kinds of lovable: Good, pleasant, useful
* Friendship of utility/pleasure
  * No intrinsic love; love by the good that comes from each other
* Friendship of virtue/good character (complete and true friendship)
  * Lasts insofar as they are good
  * Immune to slander
* **Answer to like/unlike:** in some cases the like are friends (friendship of
  pleasure and character), and in other cases the unlike are friends (friendship
  of utility).
* **Answer to good/bad:** in some cases only the good can be friends (friendship
  of character), and in other cases the bad or the neither good nor bad can be
  riends (friendship of pleasure and character).

## Friendship, family, and the city

* Friendships hold city-states together
* Some legislators take it more importantly than justice
* The extent of friendship is also the extent of justice

|      Correct (Common good)      | Deviated (Private good) |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Kingship/father-son/superiority | Tyranny/master-slave    |
| Aristocracy/good man-woman      | Oligarchy/bad man-woman |
| Timocracy/polity/brotherhood    | Democracy               |

### Family friendship

* A human being seems to be by nature more couple-forming than political
* Family is a more fundamental structure than city-states

## Political friendship

* Which kind of friendship is concord or political friendship?
* Political friendship varies in accordance with constitutions
* Nature of political community:
  * People consort together for some advantage People 
  * Come together and remain in existence

## Friendship and self-love

* Is friendship between different people derived from friendship with oneself?
  * Many properties also apply
  * Is "resemble" the same as "derive"?
  * Can different parts of the soul love each other as two friends love each
    other?
* Can a bad person be his own friend?
* Is this dispiction of the soul of a bad person realistic?
* Is it in conflict with Aristotle's own distinction between an akratic person
  and a base person?
