# Aristotle on pleasure: a contextualist introduction

## Why pleasure

* Why pleasure out of all Goods?
  * It seems most intimately related to our kind
  * We steer the young by pleasure and pain
  * Pleaseure and pain extend throughout a whole of a person's life
  * People deliberately choose pleasant things and avoid pains
* "Being noblest and best, is most pleasant of all."
* Pleasures are somewhat different from happiness?
