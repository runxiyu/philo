# Aristotle on pleasure: a contextualist introduction

## Why pleasure

* Why pleasure out of all Goods?
  * It seems most intimately related to our kind
  * We steer the young by pleasure and pain
  * Pleaseure and pain extend throughout a whole of a person's life
  * People deliberately choose pleasant things and avoid pains
* "Being noblest and best, is most pleasant of all."
* Pleasures are somewhat different from happiness?

## Kinesis (change/motion)

* Raw naturalism
  * Medical account, cause/effect
  * New naturalism, identity, further qualitifactions of the process
  * Subtle naturalism: further qualitifaction of the relevant process +
    perceptual condition

> Many things come about that make peoel give up their lives, for example,
> disease, extreme pain or calamity; evidently, in the face of these one might
> have chosen not to have been born in the fierst place if one had had that
> choice.

> We should not take life as vicious and destructive or in pains. For such a
> life is indeterminate, just as the attributes that belong to it. It will be
> more evident in the following account of pain.

> < Base and excellent character must, then, consist in pursuing and avoiding
> certain pleasueres and pains.
