# Plato's laws

|          | Broad       | Narrow                         |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Nomoi    | norms       | laws from a lawgiver           |
| Politeia | way of life | political system, constitution |
| Polis    | polity?     | city-state                     |

* Athens is the Polis we have the most evidence about
* Sparta too

## Theoretical and practical ship-building

* General theory
* Application:
  * In theory, drawing up the blueprint
  * Implementation, actually building the ship

## Structure of *Laws*

|            | General Theory                          | Practical Application                                               |
| --         | --                                      | --                                                                  |
| 1&ndash;2  | Virtue & education of citizens          |                                                                     |
| 3          | Constitutional theory                   |                                                                     |
| 4          | Preludes                                | The new city's location and geography                               |
| 5          | Constraints of human nature             | Grand prelude to its lawcode / division of property amongs citizens |
| 6          | Equality & inequality                   | The "offices" of that city, the politeia                            |
| 7&ndash;12 | Other theoretical matters along the way | The laws (nomoi) for those offices, and preludes to those laws      |
| 12         |                                         | The "nocturnal council"                                             |

## Some theoretical questions that are *not* the focus

* What makes something law?
* What gives law its authority?
* Why should we obey the laws?

The practical focus of *Laws* is:
> How to build a city that works, for all its citizens, and that
> will survive the test of time.

## Dialogue

### The interlocutors

| Character | Description        |
| --        | --                 |
| Athenian  | (unnamed)          |
| Cleinias  | of Knossos (Crete) |
| Megillus  | of Sparta          |

Setting: Crete, midsummer, a long walk to the cave of Zeus.

### The lawgiver's target 

* Clinas: Victory
* Athenian: Harmony

### The parable of the brothers

Athenian proposes two conditions:
* One judge who put the wicked brothers to dead and setu p better
  brothers to rule themselves
* Another judge who made the worthy brothers the rulers, and let the
  inferior ones live but made them agree to be ruled
* Another judge who take in hand this tribe at odds with itself, and
  without killing any of its members, reconcile them by establising laws
  that will secure their friendship with each other for the future.

Strauss thinks that the third option is worst <++>
> Strauss argued that Plato's myth of the philosopher king should be
> read as a reductio ad absurdum, and that philosophers should
> understand politics not in order to influence policy but to ensure
> philosophy's autonomy from politics.

### The whole of virtue

* Clinas: .. courage
* Athenian: .. + the rest of virtue

Plato tends to think of virtues as a singular thing, as opposed to
Aristotle's plural understanding of virtual.

## The divine goods

* Having virtue is being appropriately aggressive and appropriately
  restrained
* Wisdom is the right place on that spectrum
* You need both courage and moderation, to have wisdom, as far as the
  law goes.
