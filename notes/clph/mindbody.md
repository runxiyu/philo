# Two views of "Mind and Body" in Early China

## Monism, Holism, Dualism

* Holism/Monism:
  * There is only one fundamental principle, kind, or category of thing
  * Mind-body monism
    * Agreement on unity of mind and body
    * Materialists: mental states are simply physical states
    * Idealists: physical states are really mental states
* Dualism:
  * For a given domain, there are two fundamental kinds or categories of things
    or principles

## Soul as ruler of the body

## The Analects

* Has a great deal to say about the body

## We find a close alliance between the heart and spirit

* You cannot reduce the body into just the heart-mind.
