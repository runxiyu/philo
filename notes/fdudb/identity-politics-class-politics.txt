Burden of proof
- "I will prove two things in my speech"
- Formulate a chain of deductive reasoning to prove the motion (or its
  negation) from common principles
- Argument = burden + mechanism + impact + weighing
- Burden of proof is positively correlated to impact
- Is the argument sufficiently comparative?

Social movement debates
- Mobilizatoin: How many people will support you?
- Agenda/effectiveness:
  - Does it actually help? Is it meaningful?
- Which is more important?

Motion:
Abandon all identity politics (race, gender, ethnicity) in favor of
class politics.

PM
- What the world will look like:
  - Redistribution of resources
  - Worker unions [based on ?]
- A1 solidarity:
  - Coalitions across identities, limited resources
- A2 identity politics is fundamentally class-based:
  - False assumptions about e.g. black people are less educated

LO
- Unite people between identities and classes?
- Unity in identities is important in solidarity and campaigning for
  change

DPM
- You can keep dividing people.
- There are white old men that suffer from poverty.
- A1 makes coalitions better and bigger
  Less adversal effects of plurality voting
  Internationalization of politics [no more national identity?]
    important because of MNCs
  Interest groups are divided by sub-intersectional identities***

DLO
- Identity issues are not class issues
- Workers unions consists of men, only prioritizing male interests
  [Issue: not defined what "ignoring identity politics" means]
- [Consider: religion]
- [Potential danger: making "minority" an identity]
- [In the short term, aren't all policies of redistribution zero-sum
  games?]
- Voting manipulation because of less education


DPM+
- Abortion avail when rich enough
- Can't win elections


*TT
- Not all social changes are based on class e.g.
  - Legalisation of HRTs
  - Abortion


Meh.
